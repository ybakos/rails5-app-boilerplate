# Rails 5 Application Boilerplate

This is a starting point of a Rails 5 application that includes features common
to most applications, such as user authentication. TODO what else.

## Expectations

Ruby versions, database, etc.

TODO Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


## Development

* config/database.yml
* config/environments/production.rb
* package.json

### Customize `.env`

* `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
